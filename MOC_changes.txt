Music On Console (MOC) is an ncurses-based console audio player for Linux/UNIX.[1] It was originally written by Damian Pietras, and is currently maintained by John Fitzgerald. It is designed to be powerful and easy to use, with an interface inspired by the Midnight Commander console file manager. The default interface layout comprises a file list in the left pane with the playlist on the right.[2] It is configurable with customizable key bindings, color schemes and interface layouts. MOC comes with several themes defined in text files, which can be modified to create new layouts. It supports ALSA, OSS or JACK outputs.

Supported file formats include: MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Musepack, Speex, WAV (and other less popular formats supported by libsndfile), MOD, WavPack, AAC, SID, MIDI. Moreover most audio formats recognized by FFMpeg/Libav are also supported (e.g. MP4, Opus, WMA, APE, AC3, DTS - even embedded in video files). New formats support is under development. Internet streams (Icecast, SHOUTcast) are also supported.
